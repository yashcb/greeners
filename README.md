# Greeners 

Greeners is an platformer game made while I was college, theme of saviour and demon with a colour was idea behind this project.

It has classic platformer camera angle and player movement and it also has enemy AI with crosses to confront you.

To keep Art of game close to its theme I did make everything myself like :  
- Character art
- Landscape and Level
- Animations

It has hero, villain, scary vibe and more

This is one of most fun project I've worked on and the end result was satisfying watch and play :)
